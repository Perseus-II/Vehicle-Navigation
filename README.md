#Perseus-II AUV Control Software
###Stevens Institute of Technology, 2013

This is the software repository for Stevens Institute of Technology's entry into the Perseus-II underwater vehicle mission. The mission is to localize, idenify, and classify unexploded underwater ordnance. This software creates TCP servers that can be connected to from within the vehicle's network to allow for remote control. This communication will primarily take place over a 5GHz point-to-point wireless link between the vehicle and the shore-based operator console.
